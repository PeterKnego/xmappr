==I have a question. Where can I submit it?==

Just write it in a comment below this FAQ.

==Which JDK is required to use Xmappr?==

Xmappr uses Java annotations for configuration, so the minimum supported JDK version is 1.5.

==What are Xmapprâ€™s dependencies?==

Xmappr only needs StAX compliant XML parser (javax.xml.stream). While Java 1.6 already includes it, you have to supply your own when using Java 5. Xmappr has been tested with [http://woodstox.codehaus.org/ Woodstox] and recommends it.
