Quick example

    Let’s map this:

%{code-snippet|brush=xml|file=src/site/snippet/sample1.xml}

    to this class:

%{code-snippet|brush=java|file=src/site/snippet/sample1.txt}


    All you have to do is add @Elemet, @Attribute and @Text annotations to your classes and configuration is done.

    Mapping is than done in just three lines of code:

%{code-snippet|brush=java|file=src/site/snippet/conf-sample1.txt}


    Now head on to documentation section and start hacking. You won’t regret it!
