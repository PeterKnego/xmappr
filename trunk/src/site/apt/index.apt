About

    Xlite is a simple library for mapping XML to your Java classes.

Features

    * <<Simple configuration.>> Object-to-XML mappings are configured via Java annotations.

    * <<Partial mapping.>> Map only a part of XML document that you are interested in. Unmapped XML will be preserved on output.

    * <<XML namespaces>> are fully supported.

    * <<Preserves order>> of XML elements from input to output.

    * <<Extensible.>> Custom converters can be written to support custom type conversions.

    * <<Lightweight.>> Only 64 kb in size.

    * <<Thread-safe.>> Designed for multi-thread use.

    * <<Permissive license:>> Xlite is released under BSD license.

Quick example

    Let’s map this:
    1.<root a="2.2">
    2.    some text
    3.    <node>123</node>
    4.</root>

    to this class:
    01.@RootElement
    02.public static class Root {
    03.
    04.    @Attribute
    05.    public float a;
    06.
    07.    @Element
    08.    public Integer node;
    09.
    10.    @Text
    11.    public String text;
    12.}

    All you have to do is add @Elemet, @Attribute and @Text annotations to your classes and configuration is done.

    Mapping is than done in just three lines of code:
    1.Configuration conf = new AnnotationConfiguration(Root.class);
    2.Xlite xf = new Xlite(conf);
    3.Root root = (Root) xf.fromXML(reader);

    Now head on to documentation section and start hacking. You won’t regret it!
